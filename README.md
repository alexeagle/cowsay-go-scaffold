# Cowsay

Trivial scaffold for https://hay-kot.github.io/scaffold/

## Represents this use case

The user writes some Go code with external imports.

Maybe they just search for "golang hello world"
and paste the code found at https://yourbasic.org/golang/http-server-example/

And then they also add an external dependency on https://pkg.go.dev/nmyk.io/cowsay just for fun.
